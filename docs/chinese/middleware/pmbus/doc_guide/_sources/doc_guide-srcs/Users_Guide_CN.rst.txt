MSPM0 PMBus Library User's Guide
================================

1. Introduction
---------------

The MSPM0 PMBus Library is based on the MSPM0 SMBus library. The MSPM0 PMBus library provides a set of APIs to communicate over PMBus as a controller or a target.

2. PMBus Library Supported Features
-----------------------------------

This library was developed in compliance with the PMBus 1.3.1 specification.

2.1 PMBus Supported Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Address, memory, communication and capability related commands
-  On, off, and margin testing related commands
-  Output voltage related commands
-  "Other commands" as detailed by the PMBus specification
-  Fault related commands
-  Power good signal limits
-  Output voltage sequencing commands
-  Unit status commands
-  Parametric information commands
-  Manufacturer's information commands

2.3 PMBus Features Not Currently Implemented
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PMBus features listed below are supported in hardware but have not been implemented in this release:

-  ZONE\_READ and ZONE\_WRITE protocols

3. PMBus Example Usage
----------------------

This software library contains an example that demonstrate communication between a PMBus Controller and the TPS544B20EVM-634 evaluation module. The example configures the TPS544B20EVM-634's behavior during under-voltage or over current events.

-  pmbus\_controller\_tps544b20evm

The above example contains source code which can be compiled and loaded onto a supported device as-is. Connect SMBCLK and SMBDAT between the controller and the TPS544B20EVM-634. Ensure properly sized pullup resistors are provisioned.

3.1 PMBus Examples Supported Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  2 LP-MSPM0L1306 or LP-MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad evaluation boards
