### Low-Power Recommendations

TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3519 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0G3519).


### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3519 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#non-sysconfig-compatible-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

## Example Usage

* Run the example. `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0` turns ON LED1 to indicate driver
initialization is complete.

* LED1 is toggled by pushing S2 Button.
* LED2 is toggled by pushing S1 Button.

## Application Design Details

When this project is built, the SysConfig tool will generate the TI-Driver
configurations into the __ti_drivers_config.c__ and __ti_drivers_config.h__
files. Information on pins and resources used is present in both generated
files. Additionally, the System Configuration file (\*.syscfg) present in the
project may be opened with SysConfig's graphical user interface to determine
pins and resources used.
* `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0` defines LED1
* `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_1` defines LED2
* `CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_0` defines S2 Button
* `CONFIG_GPIO_BUTTON_1` defines S1 Button
* LED1 - Indicates that the board was initialized within
`mainThread()` also toggled by S2 Button.
* LED2 - Toggled by S1 Button

* The `gpioButtonFxn0`/`gpioButtonFxn1` functions are configured in the driver configuration
file. These functions are called in the context of the GPIO interrupt.

* There is no button de-bounce logic in the example.

### FREERTOS:

* Please view the FreeRTOSConfig.h header file for example configuration information.
