## Example Summary

The blink LED demo is a simple demo that implements a blinking LED with
FreeRTOS's tickless idle mode. The LED blinks every 1 second.

| Pin | Peripheral | Function | LaunchPad Pin | LaunchPad Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA0 | GPIOA | PA0 | J1_10 | This pin is 5V tolerant open-drain and requires pull-up.<br>J2 ON/OFF: Connect/Disconnect LED1<br>J10 1:2 5V Pull-up<br>J10 2:3 3.3V Pull-up |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | J2_13 | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | J2_17 | J101 13:14 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWDIO (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example.
LED1 will blink every 1s.

## Application Design Details

* This example shows how two tasks coordinate to blink LED1 every 1s.
* In order to blink LED1, one task passes a queue message every second to another task. 

### FREERTOS:

* Please view the FreeRTOSConfig.h header file for example configuration information.
