## Example Summary

Note: The use of "Master" and "Slave", along with "MOSI/MISO" terminology is being considered obsolete. These terms will be replaced with "Controller" and "Peripheral", and "PICO/POCI" respectively.

The following example configures the SPI as a Peripheral.
This example can be used with the spi_controller_multibyte_fifo_poll example running on another device.
This example fills up the TX FIFO with 4 bytes of data, and waits for the SPI Controller to start a transfer.
Once the CS line is active, the Peripheral transmits the data from the TX FIFO and then waits to receive
4 bytes of data from the Controller to fill up the RX FIFO.

## Peripherals, Pin Functions, MCU Pins, Launchpad Pins
| Peripheral | Function | Pin | Launchpad Pin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GPIOA | Open-Drain Output | PA0 | Red LED1 |
| GPIOA | Standard Output | PA15 | J3_30 |
| SPI1 | SPI SCLK (Clock) | PB31 | J1_7 |
| SPI1 | SPI PICO (Peripheral In, Controller Out) | PB8 | J2_15 |
| SPI1 | SPI POCI (Peripheral Out, Controller In) | PB7 | J2_14 |
| SPI1 | SPI CS0 (Chip Select 0) | PB6 | J2_18 |
| BOARD | Debug Clock | PA20 | J19_16 |

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the MSPM0 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the LP-MSPM0G3519 User's Guide.

## Example Usage
Make the following connections between the SPI Controller and SPI Peripheral:
- Controller SCLK -> Peripheral SCLK
- Controller PICO -> Peripheral PICO
- Controller POCI <- Peripheral POCI
- Controller CS   -> Peripheral CS

Compile, load and run the example. The SPI will automatically start
to transmit and receive data.

Once the example starts, the SPI Peripheral will wait to receive data. Once data is successfully received, the LED will turn on and USER_TEST pin will go low.

The SPI is initialized with the following configuration:
- SPI Peripheral
- Motorola 4 Wire with Polarity 0, Phase 0
- No parity
- 8 bits per transfer
- MSB first
