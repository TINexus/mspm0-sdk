## Example Summary

The following example expands the number of I2C controllers by utilizing the 3 I2C peripherals on the MSPM0L2228. The I2C is configured for 400 kHz transmissions. 
The device remains in SLEEP mode while waiting for an interrupt.
A specific I2C data format is expected for proper operation. <br>

I2C data packet: <br>
[I2C Address] [I2C Read or Write Indicator] [I2C Controller Indicator] [Number of Data Bytes N] [D0] [D1]..[DN]

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L2228 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L2228 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0L2228).

## Example Usage
To use this application send proper data packet to the device and connect I2C peripheral(s).
Compile, load and run the example.
After receiving the I2C data packet, the device will automatically send I2C communication on the corresponding interface and trigger a GPIO signal to request a read from the expander. The returned data is formatted such that the first byte of data signifies if there was an ACK or NACK during transmission.
