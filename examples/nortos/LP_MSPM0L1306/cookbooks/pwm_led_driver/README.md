## Example Summary

The following example configures TimerG0 to output an edge aligned PWM
signal that increases and decreases in duty cycle in a heartbeat manner to drive an LED.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA13 | TIMG0 | CCP1 | J4_39 | J3 ON/OFF: Connect/Disconnect LED2 Green |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | J2_13 | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage
Compile, load, and run the example.
TimerG0 will output a 62.5Hz edge aligned PWM signals on PA13.
Duty cycle of the PWM output will range from 10% to 90% in 1% increments.
Monitor the PWM signals on PA13.
