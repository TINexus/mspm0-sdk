## Example Summary

The following example configures TIMG4 to output a single edge aligned PWM
signal with a continuously updating duty cycle using the shadow load feature. This 
generates a sine wave output after being filtered. 
The device is configured to wait in SLEEP mode.

| Pin | Peripheral | Function | LaunchPad Pin | LaunchPad Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA10 | TIMG4 | CCP0 | J4_36 | N/A |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | J2_13 | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
TIMG4 will output a PWM signal that continuously updates it's duty cycle. 
Filter the PWM output and use an oscilloscope or similar device to see a sine wave output.
