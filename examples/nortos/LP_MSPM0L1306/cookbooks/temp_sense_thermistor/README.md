## Example Summary

This example utilizes OPA0 and ADC0 to properly condition and read from the on board thermistor of the Launchpad associated with the target device. 

This example does not implement the proper voltage to temperature conversion, as those equations and method vary by thermistor manufacturer. 
Comments are placed in code for where to add such calculations to get exact temperature readings. 
To show case actual ADC readings, this example takes an initial reading of the thermistor, 
then changes LED colors depending on if temperature has drifted above or below the initial reading.
LED Color Code:
GREEN -- Temperature has not changed
RED   -- Temperature has increased
BLUE  -- Temperature has decreased

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example.
Cool or heat portion of LaunchPad where thermistor is located to see LEDs change color. 

On powerup, the OPA pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
