## Example Summary
Performs an FFT calculation of a Q15 array using CMSIS DSP.
The example includes a sample waveform with sine waves of 2kHz and 4kHz.

| Pin | Peripheral | Function | LaunchPad Pin | LaunchPad Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | J2_13 | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | J2_17 | J101 13:14 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWDIO (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
gFFTOutput will contain the result of a FFT while gFFTmaxFreqIndex contains the index of the
frequency of maximum amplitude. The results can be observed in the debugger.
CCS contains a useful graph tool (Menu→Tools→Graph) which can be used to visualize the FFT signal.
