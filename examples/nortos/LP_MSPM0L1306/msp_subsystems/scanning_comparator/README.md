## Example Summary

This example mimics multiple integrated comparators by scanning through three different configurations on COMP0. 
The comparator is operating in fast mode and utilizing the 8-bit DAC as a voltage reference. 
The three configurations include three input pins, three voltage references, and three output pins. The example configures the comparator in first configuration, delays by 15us to account for the propagation and settling delay, reads the comparator output, and then sets the corresponding GPIO with the result. This process is repeated for the other two configurations before looping back to the beginning.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L1306 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage

Input desired signals on PA26, PA27, and PA23.
Set voltage reference values for comparator with COMP_DACCODEA, COMP_DACCODEB, and COMP_DACCODEC.
Compile, load and run the example. 
Measure the comparator outputs PA15, PA16, and PA17.
