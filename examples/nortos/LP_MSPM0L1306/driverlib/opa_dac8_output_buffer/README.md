## Example Summary

OPA is configured in output buffer configuration for the 8-bit DAC.
The output is configured for easy connection to external circuitry.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example.
OPA0_OUT will output DAC8 value.

On powerup, the OPA pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
