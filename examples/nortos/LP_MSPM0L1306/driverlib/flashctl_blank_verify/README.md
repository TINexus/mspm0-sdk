## Example Summary

This example demonstrates the blank verify command to verify if a flash word is blank. The example does this by successfully verifying a blank word, and returning a failure when a flash word is not blank. A blank flash word is defined as a flash word which has been successfully erased with the ERASE command and not yet programmed away from that non-erased state with the PROGRAM command.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example.
The flash operations will start automatically when the example is run.
The application will hit a breakpoint if there is a failure.
LED0 will blink after all flash operations are completed successfully.
