## Example Summary

This example transmits a UART packet, and then waits to receive UART data.
This example uses FIFOs with polling. It can only handle a maximum of 8 bytes
due to FIFO size.
LED toggles if transmission and reception are successful.
Internal loopback mode is enabled by default by the application and UART is
configured at 9600bps.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage
Connect RX and TX between two UART devices or using the back-channel UART.
To disable internal loopback mode, set the ENABLE_LOOPBACK_MODE define to false.
Compile, load and run the example.
LED will toggle periodically if transmission and reception were successful.
LED will remain off if there is a problem during initialization.
LED will remain on if there is a problem during data transfers.
