| PA26 | GPIOA | PA26 | J4_38 | J12 ON/OFF: Connect/Disconnect LED2 Red |
| PA13 | GPIOA | PA13 | J4_39 | J3 ON/OFF: Connect/Disconnect LED2 Green |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | J2_13 | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
RGB LEDs will toggle with red being opposite of blue and green.
