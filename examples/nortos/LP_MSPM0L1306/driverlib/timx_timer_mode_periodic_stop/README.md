## Example Summary

The following example configures TimerG instance in periodic mode and
toggles GPIO. The period starts at 500ms and decreases by 50ms each toggle
until the period is 100 ms, and then repeats. The device remains in STOP mode
while waiting for an interrupt.

## Peripherals & Pin Assignments

| Peripheral | Pin | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPIOA | PA0 | Open-Drain Output |
| SYSCTL | PA10 | CLK OUT |
| TIMG0 |  |  |
| EVENT |  |  |
| DEBUGSS | PA20 | Debug Clock |
| DEBUGSS | PA19 | Debug Data In Out |

| Pin | Peripheral | Function | LaunchPad Pin | LaunchPad Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA0 | GPIOA | PA0 | J1_10 | This pin is 5V tolerant open-drain and requires pull-up.<br>J2 ON/OFF: Connect/Disconnect LED1<br>J10 1:2 5V Pull-up<br>J10 2:3 3.3V Pull-up |
| PA10 | SYSCTL | CLK_OUT | J4_36 | N/A |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | J2_13 | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | J2_17 | J101 13:14 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWDIO (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. LED1 will toggle increasingly rapidly.

## Important Note
Early experimental samples have a known issue where the user is unable to
reconnect their debugger connection after the device has gone into STOP or
STANDBY mode. Please review advisory DEBUGSS_02 to see the steps to regain
the ability to connect the device to the debugger. This information is located
in the "MSPM0G and MSPM0L Families: Functional Differences With Early Samples"
document.
