## Example Summary

The following example configures ADC0 to trigger single conversion by software
using an internal VREF of 2.5V.
An LED turns on if the ADC input > 0.5*VREF, otherwise it turns off.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
Provide a valid voltage to A0_2 between 0 - 2.5V.
Monitor LED1 while input voltage changes.

On powerup, the ADC and VREF pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
