## Example Summary

Note: The use of "Master" and "Slave", along with "MOSI/MISO" terminology is
being considered obsolete. These terms will be replaced with "Controller" and
"Peripheral", and "PICO/POCI" respectively.

The following example configures the SPI as a Controller in internal loopback
mode to transmit and receive data.

## Peripherals & Pin Assignments

| Peripheral | Pin | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SYSCTL |  |  |
| SPI0 | PA11 | SPI SCLK (Clock) |
| SPI0 | PA18 | SPI PICO (Peripheral In, Controller Out) |
| SPI0 | PA10 | SPI POCI (Peripheral Out, Controller In) |
| SPI0 | PA8 | SPI CS0 (Chip Select 0) |
| DEBUGSS | PA20 | Debug Clock |
| DEBUGSS | PA19 | Debug Data In Out |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. The SPI will automatically start
to transmit and receive data.
The SPI is initialized with the following configuration:
- SPI Controller
- Motorola 4 Wire with Polarity 0, Phase 0
- No parity
- 8 bits per transfer
- MSB first
A SW breakpoint is set in the application to allow the user to check the value
of the received data.
