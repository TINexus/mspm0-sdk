## Example Summary

The following example uses a timer in combined capture mode (configured to
measure low pulse width) to implement 1-wire target interface. The demo is
provide as a reference for implementing 1-wire EEPROM with a similar command
structure to DS2433.

Overdrive support is included but untested.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage
Connect a 1-wire controller to PA10 (GPIO_TIMER_CAPTURE_C0_PIN). The demo
will respond to standard 1-wire commands (read/seach/match/skip ROM) and
implements the following subcommands:
 - 0x0F: Write scratchpad
 - 0xAA: Read scratchpad
 - 0x55: Copy Scratchapd
 - 0xF0: Read memory
