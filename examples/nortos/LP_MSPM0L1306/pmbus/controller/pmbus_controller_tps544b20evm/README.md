| Pin | Peripheral | Function | LaunchPad Pin | LaunchPad Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA0 | GPIOA | PA0 | J1_10 | This pin is 5V tolerant open-drain and requires pull-up.<br>J2 ON/OFF: Connect/Disconnect LED1<br>J10 1:2 5V Pull-up<br>J10 2:3 3.3V Pull-up |
| PA10 | I2C0 | SDA | J4_36 | N/A |
| PA11 | I2C0 | SCL | J2_11/J4_35 | J14 1:2 Connect to J2_11<br>J14 2:3 Connect to J4_35 |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | J2_13 | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | J2_17 | J101 13:14 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWDIO (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example on an LP-MSPM0L1306.

Connect SCL and SDA to the corresponding SCL and SDA pins on the PMBus target.

Each command is sent to target one-by-one. Check response using logic analyzer or set breakpoints to debug.
