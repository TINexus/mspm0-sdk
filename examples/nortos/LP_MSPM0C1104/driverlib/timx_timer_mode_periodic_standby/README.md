## Example Summary

The following example configures TimerG in periodic mode and toggles the LED.
The period starts at 500ms and decreases by 50ms each toggle until the period
is 100 ms, and then repeats. The device remains in STANDBY mode while waiting
for an interrupt.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0C1104 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0C1104).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
LED1 will toggle increasingly rapidly until it reaches the minimum period, and
then reset back to the original period, and repeat.
