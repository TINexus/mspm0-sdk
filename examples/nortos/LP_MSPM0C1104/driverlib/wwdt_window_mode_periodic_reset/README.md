## Example Summary

The following example configures WWDT0 in watchdog mode with a period of
500ms. Reset window 0 is set to be closed for 25% of the total period (125ms).
TimerG is configured to reset the watchdog timer periodically.
The Timer period is set to 300ms. It will successfully restart the WWDT counter
within the open window.

LFCLK is sourced from the internal low frequency oscillator (LFOSC).
The device remains in STANDBY mode while waiting for an interrupt.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0C1104 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0C1104).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
The LED will toggle at every interval of 300ms.

## Important Note
Early experimental samples have a known issue where the user is unable to
reconnect their debugger connection after the device has gone into STOP or
STANDBY mode. Please review advisory DEBUGSS_02 to see the steps to regain
the ability to connect the device to the debugger. This information is located
in the "MSPM0G and MSPM0L Families: Functional Differences With Early Samples"
document.
