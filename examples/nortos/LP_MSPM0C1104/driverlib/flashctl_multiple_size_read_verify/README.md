## Example Summary

This example demonstrates the read verify command for different data sizes.

The read verify command may be used to read a flash location and compare the data to data which is preloaded into the CMDDATA registers of the flash controller. This example shows read verify operations on multiple data sizes (8/16/32/64-bit). Successful read verify operations as well as expected failures are demonstrated.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0C1104 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0C1104).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example.
The flash operations will start automatically when the example is run.
The application will hit a breakpoint if there is a failure.
LED0 will blink after all flash operations are completed successfully.
USER_TEST_PIN GPIO will mimic the behavior of the LED pin on the BoosterPack
header and can be used to verify the LED behavior.
