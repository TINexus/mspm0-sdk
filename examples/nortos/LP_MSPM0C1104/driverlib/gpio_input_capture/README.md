## Example Summary

GPIO port interrupt with an internal pull-up resistor. Uses an input pin to
dependently drive an LED high or low.

| GPIOA | PA4 | Standard Output |
| GPIOA | PA16 | Standard Input with internal pull-up |
| SYSCTL |  |  |
| EVENT |  |  |
| DEBUGSS | PA20 | Debug Clock |
| DEBUGSS | PA19 | Debug Data In Out |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0C1104 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0C1104).
