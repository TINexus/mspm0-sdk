## Example Summary

The following example configures TimerA0 in periodic mode and
toggles GPIO every 2s using the repeat count feature.
NOTE: The repeat count feature is specific to the TimerA0 instance, and not the
other TimerA instances.
The device remains in SLEEP mode while waiting for an interrupt.

**Note: The examples for LP_MSPM0G3507 haven't been tested on silicon.
Refer to the "Early Samples Migration Guide" inside the SDK if using early experimental devices.**

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0C1104 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0C1104).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
LED1 will toggle every 2s.
USER_TEST_PIN GPIO will mimic the behavior of the LED pin on the BoosterPack
header and can be used to verify the LED behavior.
