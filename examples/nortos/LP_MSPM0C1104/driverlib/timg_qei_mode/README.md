## Example Summary
The following example configures TimerG in QEI mode (2-pin mode). The device remains in Standby mode after
QEI is configured, and will turn an LED on or off depending on motor direction.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0C1104 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0C1104).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Attach quadrature encoder. Observe on board
LED changing when motor direction goes from clockwise to counter clockwise or
vice versa. An alternative to test the example is to send a PWM into each pin,
one with a 90 degree phase shift and observe the LED change the phase is changed
from 90 degrees to 180 degrees.
