## Example Summary

DMA example with a block transfer of data from FLASH main memory to SRAM memory,
triggered by SW.

DMA channel 0 is setup as a software triggered transfer. Upon request, the DMA
copies a block of data from FLASH main memory to SRAM memory. The processor
blocks in a WFE pending the DMA interrupt, then data transfer is confirmed by
status of boolean verifyResult before executing a WFI.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0C1104 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0C1104).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Inspect verifyResult once example hits the
breakpoint.
