| Pin | Peripheral | Function | LaunchPad Pin | LaunchPad Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA0 | GPIOA | PA0 | J27_9 | This pin is 5V tolerant open-drain and requires pull-up.<br>J4 ON/OFF: Connect/Disconnect LED1<br>J19 1:2 3.3V Pull-up<br>J19 2:3 5V Pull-up |
| PB21 | GPIOB | PB21 | J27_4 | Connected to S2 button (no pull resistor) |
| PB0 | GPIOB | PB0 | J2_12 | N/A |
| PB16 | GPIOB | PB16 | J2_11 | N/A |
| PB27 | GPIOB | PB27 | J27_10 | J7 ON/OFF Connect/Disconnect LED2 Green |
| PB7 | UART1 | RX | J2_14 | N/A |
| PB6 | UART1 | TX | J2_13 | N/A |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | N/A | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | N/A | J101 13:14 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWDIO (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage

Connect the hardware that descriped in the document. Compile, load and run the example.
Push the S2 button to start program MSPM0L1306.
