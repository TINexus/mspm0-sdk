## Example Summary

The following example configures TimerA2 to output an edge aligned PWM
signal that increases and decreases in duty cycle in a heartbeat manner to drive an LED.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0G3507).

## Example Usage
Compile, load, and run the example.
TimerA2 will output a 62.5Hz edge aligned PWM signals on PB26.
Duty cycle of the PWM output will range from 10% to 90% in 1% increments.
Monitor the PWM signals on PB26.
