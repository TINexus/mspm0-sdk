## Example Summary

This example implements an SMBus target using the MSPM0 SMBus software library. This example will respond to a variety of SMBus commands to an SMBus target (see smb_controller00_all_protocols).

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example on an LP-MSPM0L1306.

Connect SMBCLK (SCL) and SMBDAT (SDA) to the corresponding SMBCLK and SMBDAT pins on an LP-MSPM0L1306 running the smb_controller00_all_protocols example. Ensure that the LaunchPads share a common ground, by connecting a jumper between GND on both LaunchPads.

Waits for command from the SMBus Controller and processes it.
