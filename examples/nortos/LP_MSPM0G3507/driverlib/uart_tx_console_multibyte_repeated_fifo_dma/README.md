## Example Summary

This example sets up the UART to continuously transmit data to output to the console via the DMA
using a Timer to write each second. This example is designed to run from the LaunchPad connected
to a PC with a console open, and verify the DMA can be used to output data to the console with
minimal use of the CPU.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
Connect to terminal if using Launchpad's back-channel UART, or connect to
external device using BoosterPack.
Configure the terminal emulator for:
- 115200 baud rate
- one stop bit
- no parity

The MSPM0 should begin to output a welcome message and an incremental test message every second. LED1 will toggle each transmit.
