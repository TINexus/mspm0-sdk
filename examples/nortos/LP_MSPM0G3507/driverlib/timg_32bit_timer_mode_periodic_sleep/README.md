## Example Summary

The following example configures a 32-bit TimerG in periodic mode and toggles
the LED every 500ms. The device remains in SLEEP mode while waiting for an interrupt.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
The LED will toggle every 500ms, and the device will remain in SLEEP while waiting
 for an interrupt.
