## Example Summary

OPA is configured in general purpose mode with rail-to-rail configuration
enabled by default.
The inputs and output are configured for easy connection to external circuitry.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage

Connect OPA0_IN0+ and OPA1_IN1- to external circuitry.
Compile, load and run the example.
OPA1_OUT will be the output of the Op-Amp.

On powerup, the OPA pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
