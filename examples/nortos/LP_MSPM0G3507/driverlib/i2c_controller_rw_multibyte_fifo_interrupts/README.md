## Example Summary

I2C Controller writes and reads multiple bytes to/from a target device.
The example uses FIFO and interrupts.
LED toggles if transmission and reception are successful.
The Target device must be enabled and active before running this example.

This example can be used to validate I2C communication, as a starting point to
control any I2C target, or to create custom drivers.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage

Connect SDA and SCL between I2C Controller and Target.
Compile, load and run the example.
LED2 will toggle periodically if transmission and reception were successful.
LED2 will remain off if there is a problem during initialization.
LED2 will remain on if there is a problem during data transfers.
