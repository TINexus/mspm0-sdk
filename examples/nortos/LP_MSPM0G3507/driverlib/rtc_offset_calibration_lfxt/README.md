## Example Summary

This example can be used to correct the crystal offset error.
Button are used to increase or decrease offset while an external tool measures
frequency using RTCCLK output.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
The output frequency for offset calibration is by default set to 512Hz.
Connect external equipment such as oscilloscope to RTC_OUT.
Press S1 to increment offset by +1PPM, S2 to decrement correction by -1PPM.
