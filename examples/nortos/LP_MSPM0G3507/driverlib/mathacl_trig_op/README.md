| Pin | Peripheral | Function | LaunchPad Pin | LaunchPad Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | N/A | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | N/A | J101 13:14 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWDIO (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
The application will stop at the break point to allow the user to verify the
three sin/cos operations.
The value of op1Cos should be 1 (0x7FFFFFFF).
The value of op1Sin should be 0.
The value of op2Cos should be 0.707 (0x5A89E374).
The value of op2Sin should be 0.707 (0x5A7B0D41).
The value of op3Cos should be 0.
The value of op3Sin should be 1 (0x7FFFFFFF).
