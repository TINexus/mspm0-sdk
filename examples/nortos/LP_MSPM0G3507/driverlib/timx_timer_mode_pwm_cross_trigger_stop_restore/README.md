## Example Summary
Two PWMs are generated for 1 second, then saves the PWM timer configuration
before going to STOP mode. The device stays in STOP mode for 1 second and then
restores PWM generation.

Some MSPM0G peripherals residing in Power Domain 1 (PD1) don't retain register contents when
entering STOP or STANDBY modes, refer to the datasheet for more details.
TimerA is a peripheral in PD1 which exhibits this behavior.
Developers can decide to re-initialize the peripheral using the default
initialization (i.e. SYSCFG_DL_TIMERA_INST_0_init) from SysConfig. This approach
is more memory-efficient.
Alternatively, this example demonstrates using DriverLib APIs to save and
restore the register configuration of the peripheral before and after entering
low-power mode. This approach is recommended if the Timer configuration is
modified at runtime.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
Monitor PWM generation before and after STOP mode.

## Important Note
Early experimental samples have a known issue where the user is unable to
reconnect their debugger connection after the device has gone into STOP or
STANDBY mode. Please review advisory DEBUGSS_02 to see the steps to regain
the ability to connect the device to the debugger. This information is located
in the "MSPM0G and MSPM0L Families: Functional Differences With Early Samples"
document.
