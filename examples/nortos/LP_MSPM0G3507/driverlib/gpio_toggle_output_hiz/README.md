## Example Summary

Toggles a GPIO configured as Hi-Z.
A logic low is forced actively, but a logic high sets the pin as Hi-Z.
This feature is useful for open-drain digital input/output applications.
This example expects an external pull-up, but an internal pull-up could be used.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PB16 | GPIOB | PB16 | J2_11 | N/A |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | N/A | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Connect an external pull-up to pin.
Compile, load and run the example.
Check output of pin. Note that without the pull-up, the pin will be in Hi-Z
when high.
