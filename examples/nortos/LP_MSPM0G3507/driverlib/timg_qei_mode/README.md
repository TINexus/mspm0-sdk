## Example Summary
The following example configures TimerG in QEI mode (2-pin mode). The device remains in SLEEP0 mode after
QEI is configured, and will turn an LED on or off depending on motor direction.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Attach quadrature encoder. Observe on board
LED changing when motor direction goes from clockwise to counter clockwise or
vice versa
