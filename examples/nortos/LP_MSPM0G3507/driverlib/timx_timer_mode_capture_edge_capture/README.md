## Example Summary

The following example configures TimerG0 to measures the time from the start of
the capture operation to the signal edge.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
Connect to PA12 (GPIO_TIMER_CAPTURE_C0_PIN) to an edge generator source (it can
also be connected to a momentary switch).
Compile, load and run the example.
Generate an edge on PA12 (GPIO_TIMER_CAPTURE_C0_PIN). This will cause
application will stop at the breakpoint instruction, and the value of
edgeCapture can be inspected.
