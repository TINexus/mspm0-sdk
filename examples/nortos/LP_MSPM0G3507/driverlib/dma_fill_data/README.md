## Example Summary

DMA example with a fill data transfer to SRAM memory, triggered by SW.

DMA channel 0 is setup as a software triggered transfer. Upon request, the DMA
fills a block of data from a constant pattern to SRAM memory. The processor
blocks in a WFE pending the DMA interrupt, then data transfer is confirmed by
status of boolean gVerifyResult before executing a WFI.

| Pin | Peripheral | Function | LaunchPad Pin | LaunchPad Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | N/A | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | N/A | J101 13:14 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWDIO (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Inspect gVerifyResult once example hits the
breakpoint.
