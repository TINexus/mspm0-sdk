| Pin | Peripheral | Function | LaunchPad Pin | LaunchPad Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | N/A | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | N/A | J101 13:14 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWDIO (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
The application will stop at the break point to allow the user to verify the
multiply and divide fixed point results.
The value of mpyRes should be set to 0.15 (0x13333333).
The value of divResultQuotient should be set to 3.75 (0x000F0000).
The value of divResultRemainder should be set to 0.
