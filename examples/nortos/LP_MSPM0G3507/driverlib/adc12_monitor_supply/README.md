## Example Summary

The following example configures the ADC to trigger single conversion in repeat
mode to monitor internal channel to monitor voltage supply and turn on
an LED if VCC > 2.5V. Otherwise, the LED remains off.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
Vary MCU voltage supply to go below 2.5V and monitor the LED.
