## Example Summary
This example demonstrate how to capture 1024 samples of a single ADC
channel using 8-bit ADC resolution mode at maximum sampling rate. A DMA
transfer is triggered every time a new result is loaded to ADC conversion memory
and will continue the transfer until 1024 samples are loaded to gADCSamples
array. Once 1024 samples are captured the ADC12 module generates a DMA done
interrupt.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Once the DMA done interrupt is triggered, the
example code will hit the break point instruction and gADCSamples array
can be inspected.

On powerup, the ADC pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
