## Example Summary
This example demonstrate how to send multiple CAN-FD messages with message IDs
0x3 and 0x4 via GPIO input interrupt using BOOSTXL-TCAN1145 boosterpack.

The least-significant bit (LSB) in the fist data byte of the packet is toggled
every time the messages are transmitted.

This example can be used with the mcan_multi_message_rx_tcan114x example project.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Connect the TCAN114x transceiver boosterpack as described in the TCAN
Evaluation Module User's Guide and monitor and receive CAN-FD packages using
mcan_multi_message_rx example project or using a CAN Bus Analyzer tool of your
choice.

Ensure the MCAN receiver is running.

Compile, load and run the example.

The example has the following Nominal and Data Rate frequencies configured:
- Nominal Bit Rate (500 kbps)
- Data Bit Rate    (2 Mbps)

When S2 button is pressed (or the GPIO detects a falling input edge), "Message 1"
will be transmitted as CAN-FD package with Bit Rate Switching (BRS) enabled using
IDs 0x4. Each time the S2 button is pressed, the LSB of the first data payload
byte will be toggled.

Message 1:
- ID : 0x04
- BRS: 0x01
- DLC: 0x01
- FDF: 0x01
- DATA[0] = 0x01 or 0x00

When S3 button is pressed (or the GPIO detects a rising input edge), "Message 2"
will be transmitted as CAN-FD package with Bit Rate Switching (BRS) enabled using
IDs 0x3. Each time the S3 button is pressed, the LSB of the first data payload
byte will be toggled.

Message 2:
- ID : 0x03
- BRS: 0x01
- DLC: 0x01
- FDF: 0x01
- DATA[0] = 0x01 or 0x00

When using this example with mcan_multi_message_rx example, the packages
controls the state of two LEDs.

Note: There is a known limitation where the example might stop transmitting
packages if the application halt execution after hitting a breakpoint. It is
highly recommended to use the free run option while testing the example.
