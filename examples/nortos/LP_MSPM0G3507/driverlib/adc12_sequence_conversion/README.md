## Example Summary

The following example configures ADC0 to trigger a sequence of conversions on 4 different channels and stores the results in 4 different buffer arrays.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example. Connect vaild inputs ranging from 0-VCC to the ADC channels, floating pins are not guaranteed to read as 0.
