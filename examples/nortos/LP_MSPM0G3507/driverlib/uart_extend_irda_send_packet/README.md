## Example Summary

This example demonstrates UART TX and RX with IrDA encoding. IrDA encoding is a feature only usable with UART Extend.

This example can be used with the uart_extend_irda_receive_packet example running on another device.

This example enables IrDA encoding and decoding, then transmits a packet of data. The device then waits at a breakpoint if the transmission is successful.
Connect the TX line to the RX line of a device running the uart_extend_irda_receive_packet and see if the other device receives the correct message.

**NOTE:** An IrDA transceiver can also be used to further ensure that the IrDA encoding and decoding is functional.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0G3507).

## Example Usage
Connect the RX and TX between two UART devices.
Ensure that the uart_extend_irda_receive_packet is running first on another device.
Compile, load and run the example.
The LED should toggle after packet is received.
